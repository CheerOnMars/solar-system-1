# CSV

A step-by-step lok at CSV methods and an example game of how they can be used in combination!

## Getting Started

When you download or clone this repo, you'll get the full lecture, notes, and files needed to run the game!

planets.rb has the entire lecture's code. You'll want to comment out the parts you're not using, moving step by step through new methods.

To get started, navigate to the solar-system directory in the terminal. Then run:

```
ruby planets.rb
```
